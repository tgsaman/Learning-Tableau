# Learning-Tableau

This repository is meant to showcase a handful of early examples of my work with Tableau. These were the very first visualizations I ever created, where I was able to practice skills with dimensions, measures, and coordinal pair data. 

<b>TO RUN:</b>

In order to view these Tableau workbooks, you will need a Tableau license. (A free trial is available on their website). Please ensure you download the requisite data sets, along with the workbooks, otherwise the workbooks will be blank.

<b>NOTES:</b>

These are rudimentary examples of using Tableau. I have worked on significantly more complex projects, but those contain propriertary data or sensitive PII, and so I have not been able to update them.

I am currently working on a handful of visualizations that use modified, synthetic, or masked data sets to show off more advanced work without any sort of privacy violations.
