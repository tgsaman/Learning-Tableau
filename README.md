# Learning-Tableau

This repository is meant to showcase a handful of early examples of my work with Tableau. These were the first visualizations I created, where I was able to practice skills with dimensions, measures, and coordinal pair data. 

TO RUN:
In order to view these Tableau workbooks, you will need a Tableau license. (A free trial is available on their website). Please ensure you download the requisite data sets, along with the workbooks, otherwise the workbooks will be blank.

NOTES:
I see these examples as rudimentary, but I wanted to throw them on my portfolio as I polish more advanced projects to display that I do actually have experience with the tool.
